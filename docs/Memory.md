# Memory

Memory in NGIN is built around a small, performance-first allocator concept and a set of composable utilities:

- Allocators are **header-only**, typically **value-stored handles**, and can be composed (tracking, thread-safety, fallback).
- Allocation is **explicit** (size + alignment) and **deterministic** when you choose deterministic allocators (e.g. arenas).
- Containers and smart pointers are **allocator-aware** and do not require the standard library allocator model.

The design goal is “real-time friendly” primitives:

- No hidden global heap abstractions (unless you explicitly use the system allocator).
- Avoid surprise allocations (SBO where appropriate, explicit `Reserve`/`Rehash`).
- Make routing decisions explicit (cookie-first, header fallback) rather than guessing with `Owns()`.

## Why This Allocator Model?

NGIN allocators are designed to be **small value types** that you can pass by value, store in containers, and compose at
compile time. This avoids:

- virtual dispatch and global state in hot paths,
- implicit synchronization,
- and “allocator object” APIs that accidentally become part of your ABI.

The result is a model that stays predictable under pressure: a call site always specifies **bytes + alignment**, and any
optional behavior (instrumentation, routing, reporting) is layered via traits or composition.

## Architecture

NGIN’s memory stack is split across two namespaces:

- `NGIN::Memory`: allocator concept/traits, concrete allocators, decorators, allocation helpers, smart pointers.
- `NGIN::Containers`: allocator-aware containers (`Vector`, `BasicString`, `FlatHashMap`, …).

The key idea is: **a minimal allocator concept for hot paths**, with optional capabilities surfaced via **traits**.

## Core Allocator Model

### `AllocatorConcept`

An allocator is any type that satisfies:

- `void* Allocate(std::size_t bytes, std::size_t alignment)`
- `void Deallocate(void* ptr, std::size_t bytes, std::size_t alignment) noexcept`

The size/alignment parameters to `Deallocate` may be ignored by implementations, but callers should pass the same values
they used when allocating to preserve correctness and enable instrumentation.

### Allocator Handles and Lifetime

NGIN containers and smart pointers store allocators **by value**, but that value is typically an **allocator handle**.

Rule of thumb:

- Allocator handles do **not** own backing memory unless explicitly documented (e.g. `LinearAllocator` owns its slab).
- If you borrow an allocator, use `AllocatorRef` and ensure the underlying allocator **outlives all allocations** made
  through that reference (including those held by containers/smart pointers).

This is especially relevant for `AllocatorRef` and `PolyAllocatorRef`, which are both non-owning views.

### `AllocatorTraits`

Rather than requiring a “fat” allocator interface, extra capabilities are probed and accessed via
`NGIN::Memory::AllocatorTraits<A>`:

- `MaxSize()` / `Remaining()` (informational; “unknown” defaults are acceptable)
- `AllocateEx()` returning `MemoryBlock` (rich allocation result: pointer, size, alignment, cookie)
- tri-state ownership query:
  - `Ownership::Owns`, `Ownership::DoesNotOwn`, `Ownership::Unknown`
  - `AllocatorTraits<A>::OwnershipOf(alloc, ptr)`

Important rule:

- **Never** treat `Ownership::Unknown` as “owns” when making a routing decision.

### Container Propagation Traits

Allocator propagation is controlled by `NGIN::Memory::AllocatorPropagationTraits<A>` with std-like defaults:

- move-propagation is enabled by default
- copy-assignment does not silently switch allocator unless opted in

This is used by allocator-aware containers such as `Vector` and `BasicString`.

## Choosing an Allocator (Quick Guide)

Use this as a starting point:

| Need | Recommended |
|------|-------------|
| General-purpose heap allocations | `SystemAllocator` |
| Fast temporary allocations with bulk reset | `LinearAllocator` |
| “Try A then B” without relying on `Owns()` | `TaggedFallbackAllocator` |
| “Try A then B” where both can reliably `Owns()` | `FallbackAllocator` |
| Instrumentation (bytes/counts/peaks) | `Tracking<Inner>` |
| Thread-safe wrapper around a stateful allocator | `ThreadSafeAllocator<Inner, Lockable>` |
| Rare dynamic dispatch over “some allocator” | `PolyAllocatorRef` |

## Concrete Allocators

### `SystemAllocator`

`NGIN::Memory::SystemAllocator` is a stateless allocator that forwards to platform aligned allocation primitives. Use it
as the default “heap” backend.

```cpp
NGIN::Memory::SystemAllocator heap;
void* p = heap.Allocate(256, 64);
heap.Deallocate(p, 256, 64);
```

### `LinearAllocator`

`NGIN::Memory::LinearAllocator<Upstream>` is an owning bump allocator:

- Allocates one slab from an upstream allocator at construction.
- `Allocate` is O(1) with `std::align`.
- `Deallocate` is a no-op (memory is reclaimed by `Reset()` / `Rollback(marker)` or destruction).

```cpp
#include <NGIN/Memory/LinearAllocator.hpp>

NGIN::Memory::LinearAllocator<> frameArena(1u << 20); // 1 MiB
void* a = frameArena.Allocate(1024, 16);
auto  m = frameArena.Mark();
void* b = frameArena.Allocate(2048, 32);
frameArena.Rollback(m);
```

Use cases:

- frame allocators
- scratch allocators
- arena-backed container builds (e.g. build a vector, then discard the arena)

## Decorator Allocators

Decorator allocators wrap an “inner” allocator and add behavior without changing call sites.

### `Tracking<Inner>`

`NGIN::Memory::Tracking<Inner>` counts current/peak bytes and allocation counts.

```cpp
using Tracked = NGIN::Memory::Tracking<NGIN::Memory::SystemAllocator>;
Tracked tracked{NGIN::Memory::SystemAllocator{}};

void* p = tracked.Allocate(128, 16);
tracked.Deallocate(p, 128, 16);
auto stats = tracked.GetStats();
```

Tracking relies on callers passing consistent sizes to `Deallocate` (or using helpers that do).

### `ThreadSafeAllocator<Inner, Lockable>`

`NGIN::Memory::ThreadSafeAllocator` serializes access to a stateful allocator via a lock.

```cpp
using ThreadSafe = NGIN::Memory::ThreadSafeAllocator<NGIN::Memory::LinearAllocator<>>;
ThreadSafe alloc{NGIN::Memory::LinearAllocator<>(4096)};
```

Notes:

- The lock type is customizable (`Lockable`), so you can choose a spin lock for short critical sections.
- Query methods (`MaxSize/Remaining/OwnershipOf`) are locked as well to avoid data races.

## Composite Allocators (Fallback + Routing)

### `FallbackAllocator<Primary, Secondary>` (requires `Owns()`)

`NGIN::Memory::FallbackAllocator` tries primary first, then secondary. It routes deallocation using `Owns()`.

This is only correct when both allocators provide reliable `Owns()`; the type enforces that requirement.

### `TaggedFallbackAllocator<Primary, Secondary>` (recommended)

`NGIN::Memory::TaggedFallbackAllocator` is the performance-first, correctness-first fallback:

- allocation writes a small header before the returned pointer
- deallocation reads the header and routes without ownership queries
- `AllocateEx` uses the `Cookie` field to expose which sub-allocator served the allocation

Use this when you do not want (or cannot implement) `Owns()`.

Cost note:

- `TaggedFallbackAllocator` adds a small constant overhead per allocation (a header plus any alignment padding) in
  exchange for deterministic routing.

```cpp
using Arena = NGIN::Memory::LinearAllocator<>;
NGIN::Memory::TaggedFallbackAllocator fb{Arena{1024}, NGIN::Memory::SystemAllocator{}};

void* p = fb.Allocate(64, 16);
fb.Deallocate(p, 64, 16);
```

## Type Erasure

### `PolyAllocatorRef` (non-owning)

`NGIN::Memory::PolyAllocatorRef` is a type-erased allocator **reference** intended for rare dynamic dispatch cases. It
does not allocate and does not own the underlying allocator.

```cpp
NGIN::Memory::SystemAllocator heap;
NGIN::Memory::PolyAllocatorRef poly(heap);

void* p = poly.Allocate(128, 16);
poly.Deallocate(p, 128, 16);
```

This is intentionally a “slow path” compared to templated allocators.

## Allocation Helpers

`NGIN::Memory::AllocationHelpers` provides safe object/array construction on top of `AllocatorConcept`.

### Objects

```cpp
#include <NGIN/Memory/AllocationHelpers.hpp>

NGIN::Memory::SystemAllocator alloc;

struct Foo { Foo(int) {} };
Foo* f = NGIN::Memory::AllocateObject<Foo>(alloc, 42);
NGIN::Memory::DeallocateObject(alloc, f);
```

### Arrays

Arrays store a small header so `DeallocateArray` can reclaim in O(1) without a user-provided count.

```cpp
NGIN::Memory::SystemAllocator alloc;
int* arr = NGIN::Memory::AllocateArray<int>(alloc, 128);
NGIN::Memory::DeallocateArray(alloc, arr);
```

## Smart Pointers (Allocator-Aware)

Smart pointers live in `NGIN::Memory::SmartPointers.hpp`.

### `Scoped<T, Alloc>`

`Scoped` is a move-only unique owner (similar to `std::unique_ptr`) that stores an allocator handle.

Use when:

- You want explicit ownership with minimal overhead.
- You want arena-friendly lifetimes (pair it with `AllocatorRef` to an arena).

```cpp
#include <NGIN/Memory/SmartPointers.hpp>

auto s = NGIN::Memory::MakeScoped<int>(123);
// uses SystemAllocator by default
```

With a custom allocator handle:

```cpp
#include <NGIN/Memory/AllocatorRef.hpp>
#include <NGIN/Memory/LinearAllocator.hpp>
#include <NGIN/Memory/SmartPointers.hpp>

NGIN::Memory::LinearAllocator<> arena(4096);
NGIN::Memory::AllocatorRef arenaRef(arena); // non-owning handle
auto s = NGIN::Memory::MakeScoped<int>(arenaRef, 123);
```

### `Shared<T, Alloc>` and `Ticket<T, Alloc>`

`Shared` is a reference-counted shared owner, and `Ticket` is a weak handle (similar to `std::weak_ptr`).

Use when:

- Ownership must cross subsystem boundaries or outlive obvious scopes.
- You accept the overhead of atomics and a control block.

- Control block is allocator-backed.
- Reference counting uses atomics.

## Allocator-Aware Containers

Containers in `NGIN::Containers` take an allocator handle type as a template parameter (defaulting to
`NGIN::Memory::SystemAllocator`) and store it by value.

### `Vector<T, Alloc>`

`NGIN::Containers::Vector` is a contiguous dynamic array that uses `Alloc::Allocate/Deallocate` directly.

```cpp
NGIN::Containers::Vector<int> v; // uses SystemAllocator
v.Reserve(1024);
v.PushBack(1);
```

Allocator propagation follows `AllocatorPropagationTraits<Alloc>` (move-propagation enabled by default).

### `BasicString<CharT, SBOBytes, Alloc, Growth>`

`NGIN::Containers::BasicString` is a small-string-optimized string:

- SBO sized in **bytes** (works for any `CharT`)
- allocator-backed heap growth beyond SBO

```cpp
using String = NGIN::Containers::String; // alias in String.hpp
String s("hello");
s += " world";
```

### `FlatHashMap<Key, Value, Hash, KeyEqual, Alloc>`

`NGIN::Containers::FlatHashMap` is a flat open-addressing hash map:

- linear probing
- backward-shift deletion (no tombstones)
- **explicit lifetime buckets** (no default-constructing N keys/values)
- allocator-backed bucket storage

Important constraint:

- `Key` and `Value` must be **nothrow move constructible** (used during backward-shift relocation).

## Patterns

### Frame Allocation Pattern (Arena + Containers)

Use a frame arena for transient work, and pass an `AllocatorRef` handle into containers:

```cpp
#include <NGIN/Containers/Vector.hpp>
#include <NGIN/Memory/AllocatorRef.hpp>
#include <NGIN/Memory/LinearAllocator.hpp>

NGIN::Memory::LinearAllocator<> frameArena(1u << 20); // 1 MiB
using FrameAlloc = NGIN::Memory::AllocatorRef<NGIN::Memory::LinearAllocator<>>;
FrameAlloc frame(frameArena);

NGIN::Containers::Vector<int, FrameAlloc> scratch(0, frame);
scratch.Reserve(1024);
// ... fill scratch ...

frameArena.Reset(); // reclaim everything from this frame
```

### Debug vs Release Composition

In debug builds you can wrap allocators for observability:

```cpp
using DebugAlloc = NGIN::Memory::ThreadSafeAllocator<
    NGIN::Memory::Tracking<NGIN::Memory::SystemAllocator>>;
```

In release builds, prefer the simplest allocator that meets your requirements (often `SystemAllocator` or an arena).

## Design Notes / Invariants

- Prefer `AllocatorTraits::AllocateEx` / cookies for routing and tooling; avoid guessing with `Owns()`.
- Treat allocator handles as cheap values; for borrowed allocators, use `AllocatorRef`.
- `LinearAllocator` is not thread-safe by design; wrap it if you need cross-thread access.
- Hash map erase and rehash can invalidate iterators/references; treat lookups as ephemeral unless you control mutation.

## Common Pitfalls

- Passing inconsistent sizes to `Deallocate` (breaks tracking and can break allocators that validate sizes).
- Using `FallbackAllocator` with allocators that can’t reliably answer `Owns()`. Prefer `TaggedFallbackAllocator`.
- Assuming erase in a flat hash map only affects the erased element (backward-shift deletion can relocate neighbors).
- Using a non-thread-safe allocator from multiple threads without a wrapper.
